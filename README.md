## Hello there👋, I am Aswath. I write and design safe, reliable low level code for micro-controllers.

### My main mantra for desiging and writing a softwares is:  "Just becasue nobody sees it, doesn't mean it has to be ugly"

- I have:
-  10+ years of experience in writing software in C++.
-  7+ years of experience in writing firmwares in C++.
-  5+ years of professional experience in building and designing products.
-  2+ years of experience in recruiting, training and building teams.
  
- I collect various dev baords and uC but mainly works on stm32, a ARM-M cortex based 32 bit micro-controller.
- Apart from C++, I have experience in working with python 🐍 and C.
- Currently learning rust 🦀.
- I publish my technical articles here: https://aswath2481.substack.com/ and personal views here: https://aswath.inksigma.com/
